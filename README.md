# canny_edge_detector_3D
Perform Canny edge detection in 3D in python.

Based on the step-by-step implementation of the Canny edge detection from https://towardsdatascience.com/canny-edge-detection-step-by-step-in-python-computer-vision-b49c3a2d8123, I derived a 3D version for applicability on 3D images.
